## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
x = 2
y = 16
z = 32
```

```{r}
x + y
y + z
```

```{r}
e = c(16, 52, 85)
```

```{r}
a = "Hipertenso"
b = "diabetes"
c = "glaucoma"
```

```{r}
is.vector(a)
```

```{r}
is.vector(x)
```

```{r}
class(b)
```

```{r}
class(z)
```
